# Predicting-and-Managing-Peak-Energy-Demand for eSC

## Project Overview
This project aimed to assist eSC, an energy company, in addressing the growing challenges of rising electricity demand during hot summer months, particularly in July. Instead of relying on costly infrastructure like new power plants, we analyzed customer energy consumption data to uncover insights and propose actionable solutions that promote smarter energy usage, prevent blackouts, and support sustainability goals.

## Data Analysis
We analyzed datasets from over 5,700 homes, which included:
- **House Attributes:** Size, number of bedrooms, and other characteristics.
- **Hourly Energy Usage:** Detailed consumption data.
- **Weather Patterns:** Regional temperature and humidity trends.

### Key Findings
1. **Cooling Systems:** Identified as the largest contributors to energy consumption.
2. **Other Major Contributors:** Lighting, cooking appliances, and plug loads.
3. **Influential Factors:** House size, number of bedrooms, and local weather conditions (temperature and humidity).

## Methodology
We built machine learning models to:
- Accurately **predict hourly energy usage** during July.
- **Simulate peak demand scenarios** under a 5°F temperature increase to assess future risks.

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. **Promoting Energy-Efficient Lighting (LEDs)**
- Recommendation: Offer rebates or discounts to encourage customers to adopt LED lighting, which significantly reduces energy usage during peak hours.

### 2. **Implementing Smart Thermostat Programs**
- Recommendation: Provide incentives for customers to install smart thermostats, enabling optimized cooling schedules and reducing unnecessary energy consumption.

### 3. **Reducing Cooling Energy Use**
- Suggestions:
  - Educate customers about sustainable cooling practices, such as using ceiling fans and setting thermostats higher when away.
  - Offer incentives for upgrading to energy-efficient HVAC systems.

### 4. **Targeting High-Consumption Areas**
- Recommendation: Use regional data to identify areas with the highest energy consumption and focus energy-saving programs in these locations for maximum impact.

### 5. **Preparing for Climate Change**
- Strategy: Simulate a 5°F temperature increase to help anticipate potential future peak energy demands and develop proactive solutions.

### 6. **Developing an Interactive Shiny App**
- Deliverable: A user-friendly app designed to help decision-makers:
  - Explore energy consumption trends.
  - Evaluate model predictions.
  - Assess the impact of various strategies.

## Impact
Our solutions provided a clear roadmap for eSC to:
- **Reduce peak energy demand sustainably.**
- **Avoid blackouts during high-demand periods.**
- **Save operational costs.**
- Align with environmental goals by empowering customers to reduce energy usage and bills.

By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning, we delivered actionable insights and tools that position eSC to meet the challenges of rising energy demand while supporting a sustainable future.
